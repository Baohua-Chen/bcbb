I'm at the [[bosc][2014 Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)]] in Boston. It's a
great two day conference devoted to open source, science and community. These
are my notes from the day 2 morning session. [[nextday][Next Day Video]] recorded all the
talks and they're available on the [[video-obf][Open Bio video site]].
